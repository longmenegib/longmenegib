HI, I am Longmene Gibril, i am passionate about software coding
hello, i keep learning to improve my self everyday. 
i don't compare my self to other programmer. i compare my self to the 
person i was yesterday and that is: me vs me

coding is my passion and my whole life

//also i am addicted to music. it keeps me up and active while working. 
Don't have time for parties, have time for cups of tea and my machine....
